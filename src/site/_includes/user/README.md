# User includes – use the components path

Custom components are loaded from **`_includes/components/user/`**, not from this folder.

Put your `.njk` files in:

`_includes/components/user/<namespace>/<slot>/`

For example: `components/user/common/afterContent/your-component.njk`

See the main README section **"User components (Digital Garden slots)"** for namespaces and slots.
